## Introduction
The Student Performance Analysis project aims to understand the factors influencing student performance and identify any gender-based disparities. The project utilizes exploratory data analysis techniques to gain insights into the dataset and provides statistical tests to evaluate performance differences between male and female students.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named StudentPerformance.csv. It includes the following columns:
- gender
- race/ethnicity
- parental level of education
- lunch
- test preparation course
- math score
- reading score
- writing score

## Analysis
The analysis consists of several steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: This step involves handling missing values, identifying outliers, and generating descriptive statistics to understand the data.
2. Data Visualization: Various plots, such as bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots, are created to visualize the distribution of scores, explore relationships between subjects, and compare performance between genders.
3. Statistical Testing: Statistical tests, such as t-tests, are performed to determine if there are significant differences in performance between male and female students.

## Results
The analysis reveals interesting insights and findings:
- Gender-based performance differences exist, with male students generally excelling in math and female students performing better in reading and writing.
- Strong correlations are observed between math, reading, and writing scores, indicating an interdependence of these subjects.
